# Task 5 - Java Utils

## üìÑ Description

### Level 1

1. Create a class that lists the contents of a given directory in alphabetical order.
2. Extend the previous class to list the entire directory tree recursively. For each item, display whether it is a directory (D) or a file (F) and its last modification date. List items alphabetically within each level.
3. Modify the previous exercise so that instead of printing the result to the console, it saves it to a TXT file.
4. Add functionality to read any TXT file and display its contents to the console.
5. Add functionality to serialize an object and then deserialize it.

### Level 2

Execute point 3 from the previous level, but parameterize all methods using a configuration file.

The parameters to configure are the directory to read and the name and directory of the resulting file.

### Level 3

Create a utility that encrypts and decrypts the files generated in the previous levels. Use the AES algorithm in ECB or CBC mode with PKCS5Padding as the padding method.
